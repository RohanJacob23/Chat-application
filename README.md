# Chat Application

My web-based chat application project, is a modern and interactive platform that utilizes Socket.IO for real-time two-way communication. It enables users to connect with each other seamlessly and engage in private conversations, fostering meaningful interactions. In addition to chat functionality, Chatify also incorporates a friend request feature that allows users to send friend requests to others using their email IDs.
